                  The students got to learn amazing ideas and innovation that
                  was not accessible to them by conventional schooling methods.
                  The support we got from different schools and the amount of
                  enthusiasm shown by students was enthralling.

                  We believe that when an initiative is taken with an aim to
                  change something there will always be some difficulty and lots
                  of effort, but after the completion, all is forgotten with how
                  much we achieved and that is important.
